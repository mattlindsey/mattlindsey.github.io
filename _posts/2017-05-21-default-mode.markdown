Many of us feel that we lack the great achievements of the entrepreneur or the wealthy businessman, but I would like to argue that the highest achievements are not of the self, but of our contributions to the happiness of mankind. 
To start, most of us have a fixed pattern of self-centered thinking that should be abandoned. We are all under the delusion that we are the absolute center of the universe and our achievements are paramount. This is a delusion that is not evil, but insidious. It blinds us to the possibilities of acting outside of our own skull-sized kingdoms, on behalf of others, or for a larger cause or goal than our own beauty, intelligence, or wealth -- or achievements.
To rectify this mode of thinking, this 'default' setting, contemplate on these six perfections rather than the self:
1. Generosity - giving without attachment
2. Morality - avoiding negatives of the body and mind
3. Patience - having a tranquil mind with the antagonist
4. Joyous Effort - being pleased to perform virtuous actions
5. Concentration - on the benefits of being generous and the shortcomings of not
6. Wisdom - which is the culmination
