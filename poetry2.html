      Try to praise the mutilated world.<br>
      Remember June's long days,<br>
      and wild strawberries, drops of ros√© wine.<br>
      The nettles that methodically overgrow<br>
      the abandoned homesteads of exiles.<br>
      You must praise the mutilated world.<br>
      You watched the stylish yachts and ships;<br>
      one of them had a long trip ahead of it,<br>
      while salty oblivion awaited others.<br>
      You've seen the refugees going nowhere,<br>
      you've heard the executioners sing joyfully.<br>
      You should praise the mutilated world.<br>
      Remember the moments when we were together<br>
      in a white room and the curtain fluttered.<br>
      Return in thought to the concert where music flared.<br>
      You gathered acorns in the park in autumn<br>
      and leaves eddied over the earth's scars.<br>
      Praise the mutilated world<br>
      and the gray feather a thrush lost,<br>
      and the gentle light that strays and vanishes<br>
      and returns.<br>
