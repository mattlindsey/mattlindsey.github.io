<p align="center"><b>Wild Geese</b><br>
<i>You do not have to be good.<br>
You do not have to walk on your knees<br>
for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.<br>
You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br>
love what it loves.<br>
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.<br>
Meanwhile the world goes on.<br>
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain<br>
are moving across the landscapes,<br>
over the prairies and the deep trees,<br>
the mountains and the rivers.<br>
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,<br>
are heading home again.<br>
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,<br>
the world offers itself to your imagination,<br>
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -<br>
over and over announcing your place<br>
in the family of things.</i><br>
